## Project Evolution
We started the project by really talking to each other and pinpointing the key things that we wanted from this project, and developing a project timeline that will help us get to there. We broke the project into various steps, 
1. Create a Discord account and a new application
2. Choose frameworks that best represents the project, suits the needs of our bot, and something we are most comfortable working with
3. 


## Results
Upon installation, our bot should help you perform the following tasks:

1. Moderation commands (e.g. kick, ban, mute)
2. A ticket system that saves transcripts as text files
